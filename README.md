- 👋 Hi, I’m @kiyeonj124
- 👀 I’m interested in `data modeling and analysis` and  `data pipeline design and management`
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data pipeline(Docker, Kubernetes, Airflow, Kafka, Redis), distributed systems(Hadoop, Apache Spark), CI/CD(Jenkins, CircleCI, Terraform, Tekton+ArgoCD) and MLOps(MLflow, Kubeflow).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data pipeline and MLOps.
- 📫 How to reach me is to send me an email to <kiyeonj88@gmail.com>
